Quick Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
Given an array arr[], its starting position is low (the index of the array) and its ending position is high(the index of the array).

Note: The low and high are inclusive.

Implement the partition() and quickSort() functions to sort the array.


public:
    //Function to sort an array using quick sort algorithm.
    void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high)
    {
        // code here
        if(low<high){
            int par=partition(arr, low, high);
            quickSort(arr, low, par-1);
            quickSort(arr, par+1, high);
        }
    }
    
    public:
    int partition (int arr[], int low, int high)
    {
       // Your code here
       int p=low;
       int i=low, j=high;
        while(i<j){
            while(arr[i]<=arr[p]){
                i++;
            }
            while(arr[j]>arr[p]){
                j--;
            }
            if(i<j){
                swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
            }
        }
        swap(arr[p],arr[j]);
        return j;
       }
